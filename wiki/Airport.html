 An airport is a transportation structure in the <a href="SimCity_series.html" title="SimCity series" class="mw-redirect">SimCity series</a>, which allows for regional transportation between different cities. It allows for increased tourism and helps boost demand for commercial services. The airport is also one of the structures that covers the most land area, sometimes making them difficult to build, especially in cities that are well-developed. Although there are positive factors, as with its real-life counterpart, high pollution and crime rates are a problem in the area around airports.
