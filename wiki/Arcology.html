You have been compensated for the construction."  SimCity Creator (DS) In <a href="SimCity_Creator.html" title="SimCity Creator">SimCity Creator</a> for Nintendo DS, arcologies will appear in the post global warming age. They are similar to the ones in SimCity 2000.  SimCity (2013)  Arcologies make a return in the form of a <a href="Great_work.html" title="Great work">great work</a> in the <a href="SimCity_(2013).html" title="SimCity (2013)">SimCity</a> reboot. Like other great works, multiple cities in a region can work together to complete the structure. Once a city in the region reaches 58,000 residents the construction of the arcology is unlocked, the region then needs to collect a million <a href="Simoleon.html" title="Simoleon" class="mw-redirect">simoleons</a>, 2,800 tons of metal, 1,000 tons of alloy and 60,000 crates of televisions. The upkeep is 300 simoleons per hour.  Launch Arcology  The Launch Arcology returns as a landmark in the <a href="SimCity_Cities_of_Tomorrow.html" title="SimCity Cities of Tomorrow">SimCity: Cities of Tomorrow</a> expansion. It is available by pre-ordering the expansion. The building is placed under the Tourism tab of the City Specializations. Upon plopping down the structure in one's city, tourists and prisoners will begin settling into the edifice. After 6,000 spots are filled, the player is given the option to launch the Arcology into deep space. Upon launch, the player would be rewarded a large sum of cash from the 'ticket sales' of the landmark.
