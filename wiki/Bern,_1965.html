Bern, Switzerland, 1965. The Player must fix Bern's traffic problem - but this is one very big problem. Almost every zone in the city is isolated from each other, and completely surrounded by Roads. Bern has a moderate crime rate problem as well, but there is a lot of empty space to work with. Without cheating, the Player may need to partially or completely rebuild the city in phases, maximizing land use while reducing the city's dependence on Roads for Rails.
