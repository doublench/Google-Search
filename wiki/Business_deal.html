The player is given the option to build a certain thing within their city. In exchange, they are paid a certain amount of money each month. The catch is that the thing that must be built is typically something <a href="NIMBY.html" title="NIMBY">undesirable</a>.        <a href="SimCity.html" title="SimCity">SimCity</a> The original SimCity planted the seeds of the business deal with the casino.

The deal is canceled if the building is destroyed.  <a href="SimCity_3000.html" title="SimCity 3000">SimCity 3000</a> Business deals <a href="Casino.html" title="Casino">Casino</a> (Increases crime and <a href="Traffic.html" title="Traffic">traffic</a>) Chemical Waste Disposal Plant</a> (Increases pollution substantially) GigaMall</a> (Decrease demand for commercial buildings) Maximum Security Prison</a> (Increases crime and pollution)  <a href="SimCity_4.html" title="SimCity 4">SimCity 4</a> Business deals made a return in <a href="SimCity_4.html" title="SimCity 4">SimCity 4</a>.
