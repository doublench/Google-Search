 The CN Tower is a <a href="Landmarks.html" title="Landmarks">landmark</a> found in both <a href="SimCity_4.html" title="SimCity 4">SimCity 4</a> and <a href="SimCity_3000.html" title="SimCity 3000">SimCity 3000</a>. Standing at 513 metres from the base of the tower to the antennae, it has the distinction of being the tallest landmark in the both games as well as one of the most expensive to construct and to maintain. The landmark is a relatively to scale version of the actual  in Toronto, Canada, which was completed in 1976.  Trivia Like other landmarks (most notably the <a href="Empire_State_Building.html" title="Empire State Building">Empire State Building</a>), the in-game version lacks the unique lighting effects that exist in real-life. SimCity 4 has a more accurate colour scheme than its predecessor.
