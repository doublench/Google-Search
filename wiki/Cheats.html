Cheats are methods to break the rules of a game, and alter its intended gameplay. It's up to each individual person whether they want to use cheats or not. Cheats may be intentionally programmed into the game, or they may exist as unpatched bugs.        SimCity PC  No maintenance on railroads - Normally, railroads will deteriorate unless transport has 100% funding. However, railroads with electrical lines over them won't. Put electrical lines over all the railroads and set transport funding to 0%.  SNES 999,999 simoleons - First spend all your money. Put the game on the fastest setting and wait for the tax grid to appear. As soon as the screen turns black, hold L + R. While holding these buttons, change all settings to 0% and exit the screen (don't release the buttons yet). While still holding these buttons, use the menu to return to the tax screen. Raise all settings to 100% except for the tax rate. Set that to 20%. Exit the tax screen and the menu, then release L and R (be sure that your money is negative).  Congratulations! You now have §999,999. You might want to lower the tax rate now. Give those SimCitizens a break!  SimCity 2000 PC     Cheat  Effect    Type "priscilla" during the game.
