ControlNet is a signal in <a href="Cities_of_Tomorrow.html" title="Cities of Tomorrow" class="mw-redirect">Cities of Tomorrow</a> that radiates from the Academy</a>. Its purpose is to control all futuristic technologies that have been researched at an Academy in the region. The amount of ControlNet produced depends on the amount of workers, with high wealth workers producing the highest amount, medium-wealth producing a moderate amount, and low-wealth producing to lowest. ControlNet acts as workers as these new technologies do not require them. However, each of these buildings take up or use a potion of ControlNet and must have enough of it to function. The player can gain extra ControlNet by plopping a ControlNet Facility</a>.
