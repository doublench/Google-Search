Vinnie is a character in <a href="SimCity_3000.html" title="SimCity 3000">SimCity 3000</a> and <a href="SimCity_4.html" title="SimCity 4">SimCity 4</a>.  SimCity 3000 Vinnie is part of a shady <a href="City_ordinance.html" title="City ordinance">ordinance</a> in <a href="SimCity_3000.html" title="SimCity 3000">SimCity 3000</a>. In this game, he is referred as a "cousin". Typing in the cheat "call cousin vinnie" will open up an ordinance called "Local Fundraising Event". Vinnie will offer 100,000 <a href="Simoleons.html" title="Simoleons">Simoleons</a> for accepting the ordinance. Declining it will let the player access the Sim Castle by typing in "zyxwvu" after declining his offer.  SimCity 4 Vinnie is seen in <a href="SimCity_4.html" title="SimCity 4">SimCity 4</a> during a police mission, where the player have to deliver (or bust) his weekly protection money drop.  Trivia Vinnie's offer is often overlooked because the "cousin" usually refers to a status in the mafia. In SimCity 4, he is referred to as an "uncle" which may mean he moved up a status in the mafia between SimCity 3000 and SimCity 4. <a href="Dr._Vu.html" title="Dr. Vu">Dr. Vu</a> may be his more "sinister" replacement, offering missions with a hefty reward at the price of mayor rating around town, instead of one ordinance.
