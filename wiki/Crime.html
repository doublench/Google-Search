This article is a stub</a>. You can help SimCity Wiki by  expanding it</a>.  Crime in SimCity is when a <a href="Wealth.html" title="Wealth">citizen</a> harms the city through a misdemeanor or felony. <a href="Police.html" title="Police">Police stations</a> lower the chance of this. <a href="Education.html" title="Education">Schools</a> also help reduce crime by raising the EQ of the population; smarter and wealthier sims are less likely to commit felonies. Although not an extremely major cause, crime also lowers an area's desirability to some extent if it is a common occurrence in the same area. If you witness a crime occurring, you can dispatch the police as you would during a disaster, but once the car gets there, the officers won't do anything to stop the crime; rather, their arrival will usually cause the crime to despawn.
