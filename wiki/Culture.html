Culture is a city specialization</a> in <a href="SimCity_(2013).html" title="SimCity (2013)">SimCity (2013)</a>. It was unconfirmed and absent from gameplay videos before the SimCity Beta. Although minor in its lack of a "growable" specialization HQ, and relatively low income, it has by far the biggest list of buildings. As it attracts and utilizes tourists, it is best to pair it with the <a href="Gambling.html" title="Gambling">gambling</a> specialization.  Buildings The buildings in the Culture specialization can be split into two categories: Standard and Wonders (of which only 3 can be built per city), with wonders having two sub-categories, Attractors and Venues. It should be noted that their exact nature is unknown and if they have effects similar to the European pre-order bonuses. Also the stats of all the wonders differ, sometimes considerably. The Statue of Liberty attracts 5000 tourists per day, whereas the Edificio Copan, for instance, attracts only a mere 150 tourists per day.
