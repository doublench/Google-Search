Downloadable contents are content that are unavailable in the base game without having to download it first. In <a href="SimCity_(2013).html" title="SimCity (2013)">SimCity (2013)</a>, there are a total of 20 DLCs, including country-specific sets and <a href="Cities_of_Tomorrow.html" title="Cities of Tomorrow" class="mw-redirect">Cities of Tomorrow</a> pre-order bonuses. <a href="Cities_of_Tomorrow.html" title="Cities of Tomorrow" class="mw-redirect">Cities of Tomorrow</a> can also be considered a DLC, as its content is separate from the base game, however, as it has more content than that of a DLC and is also available physically, it is considered an expansion pack.
