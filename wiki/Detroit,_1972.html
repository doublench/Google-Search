Detroit, Michigan, United States, 1972.  Crime runs rampant in the city of Detroit, and unlike in Real History, the Player has a chance to save the city from doom. Zoning-wise, the city isn't too poorly laid out (certainly not as bad as Bern), but the Airport should probably be moved or the zones around it removed and replaced with Park land. More Police stations are necessary of course, as well as re-planning the locations of the ones that exist, however, more police isn't the only answer. Raising land values by locating Residential Zones towards the center of the map, and along the river, in phases of "urban renewal" and reconstruction might also be necessary. As a side note, the city is fed from Power Plants on the Windsor, Ontario, Canada side of the river. The Player could take advantage of the unused land that should make up Windsor for additional development.
