Electronics is a type of city specialization</a> in <a href="SimCity_(2013).html" title="SimCity (2013)">SimCity (2013)</a>. The electronic specialization focuses on advanced technology. The logistics can become a problem, because many different goods are needed, and usually there's both import and export involved. The first tier of electronics is to produce processors, which are made from <a href="Mining.html" title="Mining">alloy</a> and <a href="Drilling.html" title="Drilling">plastic</a>. Like any other trade good, processors can be sold on the global market. The advanced technology are computers and televisions, which use the processors, but also more alloy and plastics. A good education system is required to start out.        Materials Required <a href="Mining.html" title="Mining">Alloy</a>  Alloy is created by smelting coal and ore and is an advanced product of the Mining specialization. It is used for creating processors and computers, as well as several <a href="Great_work.html" title="Great work">great works.</a>  <a href="Drilling.html" title="Drilling">Plastic</a>  Plastic is created by refining oil, and is an advanced product of the Oil specialization. It is used for making televisions and processors.  Produced Processors  Processors are the basic product of the electronics specialization, the are created using plastic and alloy, and they are used in computers and televisions, as well as some <a href="Great_work.html" title="Great work">great works</a>.  Computers Televisions  Production Processors Made in the Processor Factory</a>. Default production:  Material storage capacity: 10 tons of alloy, 1,000 crates of plastic. Product storage capacity: 1,000 crates of processors. Costs: §160,000  Upkeep: -§700/hr  Production: 2,400 crates of processors  Usage: 12 ton <a href="Mining.html" title="Mining">alloy</a> and 1200 crates of <a href="Drilling.html" title="Drilling">plastic</a>.  Add-on (comes with 1 free, max 4):  Product storage capacity: 1000 crates of processors. Cost: §50,000 Upkeep: -§350/hr Production: 2,400 crates of processors Usage: 12 ton <a href="Mining.html" title="Mining">alloy</a> and 1200 crates of <a href="Drilling.html" title="Drilling">plastic</a>.  Fully upgraded:  Product storage capacity: 4000 crates of processors. Cost: §310,000 Upkeep: -§1,750/hr Production: 9,600 crates of processors Usage: 48 ton <a href="Mining.html" title="Mining">alloy</a> and 4,800 crates of <a href="Drilling.html" title="Drilling">plastic</a>.  Like any other production facility, processor factories come with a free cargo truck, and 3 more can be made for a total of 4. The cost is §10,000 and the upkeep is -§50/hr. The truck can move 200 crates per trip. They only move processors.  Televisions Made in the Consumer Electronics Factory</a>. (Needs Electronic INC.) Default production:  Material storage capacity: 1,000 crates of processors, 10 tons of alloy, 1,000 crates of plastic. Product storage capacity: 1,000 crates of finished goods. Costs: §360,000 Upkeep: -§1,200/hr  Production: 3,600 crates of televisions Usage: 1,800 crates of processors and 1,800 crates of <a href="Drilling.html" title="Drilling">plastic</a>.  Add-on (comes with 1 free, max 4):  Product storage capacity: 1,000 crates of finished goods. Cost: §100,000 Upkeep: §750/hr Production: 3,600 crates of televisions Usage: 1,800 crates of processors and 1,800 crates of <a href="Drilling.html" title="Drilling">plastic</a>.  Fully upgraded:  Material storage capacity: 1,000 crates of processors, 10 tons of alloy, 1000 crates of plastic. Product storage capacity: 4,000 crates of finished goods. Cost: §660,000 Upkeep: §3,450/hr Production: 14,400 processors Usage: 7,200 crates of processors and 7,200 crates of <a href="Drilling.html" title="Drilling">plastic</a>.  3 processor factories could theoretically keep up with 4 consumer electronic factories. (either computers or televisions). It only takes a single refinery (with 3 plastic polymizers) to keep up with the plastic production. Like any other production facility, consumer electronic factories come with a free cargo truck, and 3 more can be made for a total of 4. The cost is §10,000 and the upkeep is §50/hr. The truck can move 200 crates per trip, and they can only move computers and televisions.  Computers Made in the Consumer Electronics Factory</a>. (Needs Electronic INC.) Default production:  Material storage capacity: 1,000 crates of processors, 10 tons of alloy, 1,000 crates of plastic. Product storage capacity: 1,000 crates of finished goods.  Costs: §360,000  Upkeep: -§1,200/hr   Production: 3,600 crates of televisions (Note: they produce televisions by default).  Usage: 1,800 crates of processors and tons of <a href="Drilling.html" title="Drilling">alloy</a>.  Add-on (comes with 0 free, max 4):  Product storage capacity: 1,000 crates of finished goods. Cost: §280,000 Upkeep: -§850/hr Production: 3,600 crates of computers Usage: 1,800 crates of processors and 18 tons of <a href="Drilling.html" title="Drilling">alloy</a>.  Fully upgraded:  Material storage capacity: 1,000 crates of processors, 10 tons of alloy, 1000 crates of plastic. Product storage capacity: 4,000 crates of finished goods. Cost: §660,000 Upkeep: -§3,450/hr Production: 14,400 crates of computers Usage: 7,200 crates of processors and 72 tons of <a href="Drilling.html" title="Drilling">alloy</a>.  3 processor factories could theoretically keep up with 4 consumer electronic factories. (either computers or televisions). It only takes a single smelting plant (with 3 alloy smelters) to keep up with the alloy production. Like any other production facility, consumer electronic factories come with a free cargo truck, and 3 more can be made for a total of 4. The cost is §10,000 and the upkeep is -§50/hr. The truck can move 200 crates per trip, they only move computers and televisions.
