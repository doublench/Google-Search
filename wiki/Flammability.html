A graph/plot chart was first implemented in SimCity 3000 and its <a href="Sim_City_3000_Unlimited.html" title="Sim City 3000 Unlimited" class="mw-redirect">expansion</a>, though the statistic itself may have existed in <a href="SimCity_2000.html" title="SimCity 2000">SimCity 2000</a> and earlier. Since then, flammability statistics have been available in SimCity games after SimCity 3000.Â    This article is a stub</a>. You can help SimCity Wiki by  expanding it</a>.
