Freeland is a scenario</a> present in the <a href="SimCity_(SNES).html" title="SimCity (SNES)">SNES version of SimCity</a>. The scenario is set in 1991, and is a huge, blank canvas with the forest in the shape of Mario's face. There is no time limit, no goal, as this is an exercise for the player to try and absolutely max out the population of a map. However, the presents that are part of the SNES port are not available to the player, as this is a scenario, not a regular build map, thus, the only way to have high land values is to build zones towards the very center of the map.
