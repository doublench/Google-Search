A growable building is a feature seen in most <a href="SimCity_series.html" title="SimCity series" class="mw-redirect">SimCity</a> games. Growable buildings will only grow on zoned tiles, the demand is high enough, the population is large, the desirability for the zoned area is high enough. Growable building differs from ploppable buildings</a> by that the buildings cannot be plopped by the player. In <a href="SimCity_4.html" title="SimCity 4">SimCity 4</a>, when starting a new region, the first buildings starts at stage 1, the lowest <a href="Density.html" title="Density">density</a>. Buildings that may be the result of a building growing (going up a stage) can include several combinations, such as a long group of houses becoming an apartment building or 2 homes becoming a brick walk up. Buildings in commercial areas will sometimes become small sets of shops that will house slightly more jobs than a single business. After a building has reached its stage limit (3 for low density, 6 for medium density, and 8, the highest stage, for high density), a building will no longer expand, unless it has been rezoned into a higher density. However, some buildings will not expand, specifically in agricultural areas, Civic buildings are another building that does not grow, but higher level versions can be unlocked. The smallest of these will take up 4 spaces.  This article is a stub</a>. You can help SimCity Wiki by  expanding it</a>.
