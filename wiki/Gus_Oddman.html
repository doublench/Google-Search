He earned a degree in Applied Pipes and Wires (Summa Cum Mediocre) before entering public service as a grout width inspector in the Beezeltown Office of Municipal Brickwork. Gus's ability to understand complex systems and to sidestep most major decisions made for his steady ascent up the ladder of public service.
