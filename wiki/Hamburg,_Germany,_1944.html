Hamburg, Germany, 1944 Perhaps a controversial Scenario, given World War II and the political debate that it causes, the Bombing Campaign of the Allies against Hamburg caused significant damage to the city. In the game (present in SimCity (1989) and NOT in the SNES Port), the Player must mitigate the damage caused by the bombing campaign, and rebuild whatever gets destroyed. The "bombing runs" are actually multiple "plane crash" disasters in that they destroy an X-shaped area, just like a Plane Crash does. However, each "bombing attack" has multiple of these explosions. Some land harmlessly on blank land, others will land all over the place in the city.
