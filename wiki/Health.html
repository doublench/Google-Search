Health refers to the general health and well-being of a city's Sims. Healthy Sims will have a longer life and will be able to stay in the workforce longer, contributing to the economy of the city. Also, mid to high wealth residents tend to prefer areas with decent health coverage, which means unless the player wants their city to continue to resemble a large slum, proper health coverage is important, especially in a well-established city.        SimCity Health isn't actually measured in the original <a href="SimCity.html" title="SimCity">SimCity</a>. However, hospitals</a> can appear in residential areas with a high land value.  SimCity 2000 <a href="SimCity_2000.html" title="SimCity 2000">SimCity 2000</a> was the first game in the series to measure health as life expectancy. The player was given the option to build hospitals to provide healthcare to sims. Unlike police and fire stations, hospitals don't have an area of effect; they affect the entire city. The quality of care goes down if hospitals become overcrowded or don't get enough funding.  SimCity 3000 Health in <a href="SimCity_3000.html" title="SimCity 3000">SimCity 3000</a> works the same as SimCity 2000. No changes were made.  SimCity 4 <a href="SimCity_4.html" title="SimCity 4">SimCity 4</a> added clinics</a>, which act as smaller, local hospitals. Unlike previous installments of SimCity, the hospitals and clinics in SimCity 4 have a radius of effect, similar to police and fire stations. Also, doctors will strike if the hospitals are underfunded. The player can also get the disease research center as a reward, which will improve health across the city, but will lower land value in the surrounding area. Rush Hour's <a href="U-Drive-It_Mode.html" title="U-Drive-It Mode" class="mw-redirect">U-Drive-It Mode</a> gives the player the option to control the hospital's vehicles. The player can drive an ambulance or fly a medical helicopter to complete various missions, or just explore the map.  SimCity (2013) This section requires expanding.
