 Highways are present in some fashion or another in most <a href="SimCity_series.html" title="SimCity series" class="mw-redirect">SimCity</a> games and generally offer the pinnacle of driving infrastructure to <a href="Sims.html" title="Sims" class="mw-redirect">Sims</a>.   Because of their large and complex construction, they are also expensive to maintain. However, a well placed highway system between residential and commercial/industrial zones will provide useful service and due to its high road capacity, many traffic problems that occur on streets</a> and <a href="Road.html" title="Road">roads</a> will be reduced.        SimCity 2000 Highways, debuting in <a href="SimCity_2000.html" title="SimCity 2000">SimCity 2000</a>, are elevated. Highways are connected to roads via onramps. Intersecting highways create an otherwisely simple interchange.  SimCity 3000 Elevated highways return in <a href="SimCity_3000.html" title="SimCity 3000">SimCity 3000</a>. Highway interchanges are made by adding either onramps or highway pieces to intersecting highways. A popular trend among players is to directly connect avenues (two parallel roads) with a highway. However the game treats this interconnection as broken: no traffic will use this particular connection.  SimCity 4 SimCity 4: Rush Hour</a> included two types of highways: elevated highways and the all-new ground highways. Avenues and highways can now interconnect, as well as the addition of cloverleaf interchanges and T-interchanges.  Mods See also: Real Highway Mod</a>   A popular mod for SimCity 4 is the Real Highway Mod</a>, included as part of the <a href="Network_Addon_Mod.html" title="Network Addon Mod">Network Addon Mod</a>, which allows the player to build a more realistic looking highway, as well as allowing the player to create a custom interchange.  SimCity (2013) Highways and railways are pre-built in <a href="SimCity_(2013).html" title="SimCity (2013)">SimCity (2013)</a> for connecting cities. While railways can be extended for building stations, highways cannot be modified much more than connecting the main road to the T-interchange.
