Jacques Servin was a former Maxis employee known for planting the infamous <a href="SimCopter.html" title="SimCopter">SimCopter</a> Easter egg. He was fired for the egg.  The SimCopter Egg The SimCopter egg was a hidden feature in 1996 game SimCopter. If you complete a mission on either his birthday, his partner's birthday, and any Friday the 13th, loads of men in speedos will kiss each other instead of the normal marching band. He planted the egg because he felt that his boss, Will Wright was, as he put it, "excessively heterosexual".  Personal life Since the SimCopter incident, Servin became a political activist, founding the group "The Yes Men" with Igor Vamos.   References
