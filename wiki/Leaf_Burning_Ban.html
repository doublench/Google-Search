 The Leaf Burning Ban is an ordinance available in SimCity3000. It is an no cost-income ordinance and helps prevent fires. It is akin to the Smoke Detector Ordinance.  Notes &amp; Trivia The leaf burning ban wouldn't prevent fires like the one pictured to the right, as the picture is from SimCity 4, not SimCity 3000.
