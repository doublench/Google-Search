Throughout the <a href="SimCity_series.html" title="SimCity series" class="mw-redirect">SimCity</a> series, players need to lay down <a href="Power_plant.html" title="Power plant">power plants</a> to power nearly everything in town with few exceptions. These power plants have major advantages and disadvantages, mostly costs and <a href="Pollution.html" title="Pollution">pollution</a>. Without a power plant, the city won't grow. Here are the following power plants featured in the SimCity series:        <a href="SimCity.html" title="SimCity">SimCity</a> This section requires expanding. Consider helping SimCity Wiki by expanding</a> this section.  Coal Nuclear <a href="SimCity_2000.html" title="SimCity 2000">SimCity 2000</a> All power plants disintegrate after exactly 50 years, unless noted otherwise.  Coal The <a href="Coal_power_plant.html" title="Coal power plant">coal power plant</a> performs the same as the one in SimCity.  Hydro Dam These hydro dams</a> are relatively cheap to build and are a solid source of power while producing no pollution at all. However, they can only be placed at waterfalls and produce little power per dam and thus require a large amount of money when bought in bulk. As they are one of only two plants not to disintegrate after 50 years (the other being wind turbines) they are a good investment for people who have the money to buy a multitude of them.  Oil The oil power plant</a>, while slightly more expensive than coal, produces comparatively more power and less pollution.  Natural Gas The natural gas power plant</a> are cheap but as with hydro dams produce less power and thus require more to be build. For a fuel burning plant, they are very clean.  Nuclear The <a href="Nuclear_Power_Plant.html" title="Nuclear Power Plant" class="mw-redirect">nuclear power plant</a> are the same as the one in SimCity, but is considered cheap compared to the other plants. When the Nuclear Free Zone ordinance is enacted, Nuclear Power Plants can no longer be built and existing ones will disintegrate. If this power plant has not been discovered and this ordinance is enacted, its discovery will also not show up in any newspapers.  Wind Turbine Costing $100 each, the <a href="Wind_power_plant.html" title="Wind power plant">wind turbine</a> is the cheapest way to get power and are considered more reliable than solar. They also don't disintegrate after 50 years making them a good investment.  Solar On cloudy days, the solar power plant</a> will provide little to no power at all. On sunny days however, it is a clean and relatively cheap way to get power.  Microwave The microwave power plant</a> is clean, reliable, reasonably priced and produces a lot of power. The only drawback lies in the risk of a <a href="Microwave.html" title="Microwave">beam being misfired</a>, though potentially blowing up a building and starting a fire is not much of a disaster compared to a <a href="Nuclear_Meltdown.html" title="Nuclear Meltdown" class="mw-redirect">nuclear meltdown</a>.  Fusion The <a href="Fusion_power_plant.html" title="Fusion power plant">fusion power plant</a> is the ultimate power source of the future. Requiring a large sum of money, it is clean, reliable, provides a lot of power and has no risk of having a meltdown.  <a href="SimCity_3000.html" title="SimCity 3000">SimCity 3000</a> Coal The <a href="Coal_power_plant.html" title="Coal power plant">coal power plant</a> is a cheap source of electricity per MWh, but also produces the most pollution.  Oil The oil power plant</a> is imilar to coal but yields more electricity, produces slightly less pollution compared to coal power plants, but is more expensive.  Gas The gas power plant</a> is a lot cleaner than coal but has half the capacity.  Nuclear The <a href="Nuclear_Power_Plant.html" title="Nuclear Power Plant" class="mw-redirect">nuclear power plant</a> produces lots of power, is expensive, very low pollution, but carries a risk of a nuclear <a href="Nuclear_Meltdown.html" title="Nuclear Meltdown" class="mw-redirect">meltdown</a> if it is destroyed, overused, or if it ages out. Demolish before it blows up to prevent a meltdown.  Solar The solar power plant</a> is similar to the one on <a href="SimCity_2000.html" title="SimCity 2000">SimCity 2000</a>, but isn't at the whim of the weather.  Wind The <a href="Wind_power_plant.html" title="Wind power plant">wind power plant</a> is cheap but barely generates electricity, it is more effective when built on the top of hills (including along shores).  Microwave The microwave power plant</a> is clean and generates a lot of power but is expensive, unlike in <a href="SimCity_2000.html" title="SimCity 2000">SimCity 2000</a>, there isn't the risk of a misaimed beam causing havoc.  Fusion The <a href="Fusion_power_plant.html" title="Fusion power plant">fusion power plant</a> is clean and generates a lot of power but is very expensive, unlike nuclear there isn't the risk of a meltdown.  <a href="SimCity_4.html" title="SimCity 4">SimCity 4</a> Below are all of the power plants available in the vanilla (un-modded) version of <a href="SimCity_4.html" title="SimCity 4">SimCity 4</a>.
