This is a list of <a href="Reward_building.html" title="Reward building">reward buildings</a> and <a href="Business_deal.html" title="Business deal">business deals</a> available in <a href="SimCity_4.html" title="SimCity 4">SimCity 4</a> and SimCity 4: Rush Hour</a> expansion pack.        Business deals Casino The <a href="Casino.html" title="Casino">Casino</a> can only be built if Legalize Gambling <a href="City_ordinance.html" title="City ordinance">ordinance</a> is enacted, otherwise it won't be available. The side effect is that it acts as a huge magnet to crime, on top of the crime increase caused by the ordinance. While it does increase commercial desirability around it, the crime mostly negates the effect.  Federal Prison The Federal Prison</a> should be kept away from residential areas as it has a tremendous effect on residential (as well as commercial) desirability. However, it does act as a larger jail in case you need the capacity.  Missile Range The Missile Range</a> easily provides the most income of all the business deals. However, there's a chance of a misfire, which can hit the city and destroy several buildings. This makes it a quite risky business deal to utilize.  Toxic Waste Dump The <a href="Toxic_Waste_Dump.html" title="Toxic Waste Dump">Toxic Waste Dump</a> generates huge amounts of pollution, including radiation, which means it cannot be built anywhere near civilization since Sims abhor radiation. It does provide quite some income, though.  Army Base The Army Base</a> is another producer of radiation (even if not much). However it does have a slight positive effect on commercial desirability and, interestingly, increases the industrial manufacturing <a href="Zones.html" title="Zones">demand cap</a>. It may be the most worthwhile out of all the business deals.  Reward buildings Mayor's House The Mayor's House</a> acts as a large park in that it tremendously increases desirability for both residential and commercial population around it. It also has a slight positive effect on the Mayor Rating.  House of Worship 1 The <a href="House_of_Worship.html" title="House of Worship">House of Worship</a> has a positive effect on residential population, so build it where your people live. Each individual House of Worship also raises the middle-wealth residential <a href="Zones.html" title="Zones">demand cap</a>.   Cemetery 1 The <a href="Cemetery.html" title="Cemetery">cemetery</a>'s main purpose is removing air pollution. As it's free as well, there's no reason to not build it.  Mayor's Statue</a> Even though this has a slight positive effect on its surroundings, the main reason for this reward is decoration.  Farmer's Market The Farmer's Market</a> provides a nice health boost to your residents and on top of that raises the residential <a href="Zones.html" title="Zones">demand cap</a> tremendously.  House of Worship 2 Simply an another House of Worship, with the same effect.  Impressive Mayor's Statue</a> Another Mayor's Statue to build in the city.  Country Club The Country Club</a>, besides acting as a supersized park, raises the high-wealth residential <a href="Zones.html" title="Zones">demand cap</a>.  State Fair The State Fair</a> doesn't have too many good things about it. It raises commercial desirability, but is a huge crime magnet, which pretty much negates the aforementioned effect.  University The <a href="University.html" title="University">University</a> is a great help to any educational system, however it is extremely expensive so you will not be likely to be able to afford one until late in the game.  Major Art Museum The Major Art Museum</a> provides a great boost to education especially for older Sims, however it is very expensive to maintain.  Radio Station The Radio Station</a>'s main purpose is to raise the <a href="Zones.html" title="Zones">demand cap</a>. It slightly raises commercial desirability around it as well.  Cemetery 2 Another cemetery for you to build.  Minor League Stadium The Minor League Stadium</a> is a huge relief for the <a href="Zones.html" title="Zones">demand cap</a>. However, people don't like to live next to it, so build it in the commercial areas if possible.  Main Library The Main Library</a> is the average people's counterpart to the Major Art Museum. It's cheaper and probably more worthwhile to get (but still rather expensive).  House of Worship 3 Another House of Worship to build.  Magnificent Mayor's Statue</a> Another Mayor's Statue to build.  Disease Research Center The Disease Research Center</a> cause a boost to health. Its capacity is very high; however it will most likely never get very many patients so the capacity cost is negligible. It also generates radiation.  Opera House The Opera House</a> is not a good building to build. Not only is its maintenance cost rather high, but due to a bug, it will actually reduce education in large cities due to overcrowding.  Tourist Trap The Tourist Trap</a> helps with commercial desirability and also raises the residential <a href="Zones.html" title="Zones">demand cap</a>.  Convention Center The Convention Center</a> is great to build in commercial districts. It also helps with the commercial office <a href="Zones.html" title="Zones">demand cap</a>.  Television Studio The Television Studio</a> is similar to the Radio Station in effect. However, do not build it in your residential areas as people do not like to live next to one.  Cemetery 3 Another cemetery to build.  City Zoo The City Zoo</a> greatly raises the <a href="Zones.html" title="Zones">demand cap</a>.  City Hall The <a href="City_Hall.html" title="City Hall" class="mw-redirect">City Hall</a> doesn't do much other than being decoration. It has a slight positive effect on commercial areas.  Resort Hotel The Resort Hotel</a> provides some jobs and helps with the residential <a href="Zones.html" title="Zones">demand cap</a>.  Courthouse The <a href="Courthouse.html" title="Courthouse">Courthouse</a> has largely a similar effect to the City Hall, and isn't much more worth it either.  Bureau of Bureaucracy Same here. Especially the requirement of a fully funded health and education system, which creates extreme additional costs, makes this not at all worthwhile to pursue.  Major League Stadium The Major League Stadium</a> is basically a beefed up version of the minor league stadium. However, it is quite expensive. Like the minor league stadium, keep it away from residential areas.  Movie Studio The Movie Studio</a> doesn't have much of an effect, but since it's free, there is no reason to not build it.  House of Worship 4 Another House of Worship to build.  Colossal Mayor's Statue</a> The last statue of the player for the city.  Stock Exchange As its name would suggest, the Stock Exchange</a> is excellent for the commercial areas.  Advanced Research Center The Advanced Research Center</a> mostly raises the high-tech industrial <a href="Zones.html" title="Zones">demand cap</a>. Like the Disease Research Center, it generates radiation, so keep it away from residential areas.
