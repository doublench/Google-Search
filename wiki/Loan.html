A loan is borrowed money. Players can take out loans to pay for something that's not in the city budget. However, they'll be expected to pay it back with interest. It's a good idea only to take out a loan when absolutely necessary.        SimCity Loans became available in the original <a href="SimCity.html" title="SimCity">SimCity</a> after the player earned the bank reward. The player could take out a loan of §10,000. However, players had to pay back $500 each year, along with an extra §500 of interest.

Unlike in SimCity, the interest rate flucuates based on the federal interest rate and the player's loan rating. The player can also choose to start a city with §10,000 bond with a 3% interest rate.  SimCity 3000 Loans in <a href="SimCity_3000.html" title="SimCity 3000">SimCity 3000</a> are handled differently. The player can take out up to ten loans at a time.
