 Mass transit is a form of transportation that allows many Sims to ride together, rather than having a bunch of people go in cars individually. Mass transit is expensive to set up, however, it keeps <a href="Traffic.html" title="Traffic">traffic</a> down and cuts down on <a href="Pollution.html" title="Pollution">pollution</a>.        SimCity <a href="SimCity.html" title="SimCity">SimCity</a> had only one form of mass transit available: railroads</a>. A rail station</a> was available as a reward. The rail station would improve mass transit service.  SimCity 2000 <a href="SimCity_2000.html" title="SimCity 2000">SimCity 2000</a> added a few new options. The bus depot</a> created a bus system affecting an area around it. Also new were subways</a>, which worked exactly like rails except underground. The player could even attach rails and subway tunnels.  SimCity 3000 No mass transit changes were made between <a href="SimCity_2000.html" title="SimCity 2000">SimCity 2000</a> and <a href="SimCity_3000.html" title="SimCity 3000">3000</a>.  <a href="SimCity_4.html" title="SimCity 4">SimCity 4</a> <a href="SimCity_4.html" title="SimCity 4">SimCity 4</a> made several changes. The <a href="Bus.html" title="Bus">bus</a> system was changed to work with a system of bus stops</a> rather than bus depots. Also, there are two types of train station</a> in this game. One is for passengers, the other is for freight. The player also has transit mode to help them understand how Sims are traveling. The subway system also made a return to the game, albeit, worked slightly differently than the railroad network. <a href="Rush_Hour.html" title="Rush Hour" class="mw-redirect">Rush Hour</a> added new options to mass transit. The Grand Railroad</a> reward was made available as well as the option of <a href="Monorail.html" title="Monorail">monorails</a> and elevated rails</a>. Elevated rails could connect to a subway system by means of a connecting piece, making both networks completely compatible with each and interchangeable.  Parking garages</a> to increase public transit's effectiveness was also added. The player could also add ferries</a> to get people across rivers without driving across a bridge. The player can also drive some of their public transportation vehicles in <a href="U-Drive-It_mode.html" title="U-Drive-It mode" class="mw-redirect">U-Drive-It mode</a>, including a city bus, a ferry, and several types of train.  SimCity (2013) <a href="SimCity_(2013).html" title="SimCity (2013)">SimCity (2013)</a> consists of five types of mass transit: buses, streetcars, trains, ferries and air. An additional type of mass transit was introduced in <a href="Cities_of_Tomorrow.html" title="Cities of Tomorrow" class="mw-redirect">Cities of Tomorrow</a>, the <a href="Maglev.html" title="Maglev">Maglev</a>.
