A MegaTower is a ploppable building introduced in <a href="Cities_of_Tomorrow.html" title="Cities of Tomorrow" class="mw-redirect">Cities of Tomorrow</a>. MegaTowers are much taller than their high-rise counterparts, as well as being much more flexible. A MegaTower is also a futurizationÂ source, causing nearby roads and buildings to futurize. Players can plop modules such as an apartment level, a mall level, or an office level, as well as service modules such as a nuclear reactor level or a education level, which can allow a MegaTower to be self-sufficient. A single MegaTower can hold up to eight floors. Once the eighth floor are built, the option to build a crown will be available. Crowns usually have a positive effect within the city, or the MegaTower itself. A crown's effect can also be boosted with additional crowns of the same type in the region, boosting up to five times in total. There are two main types of MegaTowers available: normal MegaTowers (which holds low and medium wealth Sims) and Elite MegaTowers (which holds medium and high wealth Sims).        MegaTower The MegaTower is the basic version that hold low and medium wealth Sims. It is generally the "poorer" version of the two MegaTowers, but also holds a higher amount of Sims and jobs. It is also primarily filled with billboards and holds a darker, more "dystopian" feel, in stark contrast to the elite MegaTower.  Modules Elite MegaTower Modules This article is a stub</a>.
