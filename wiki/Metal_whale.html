The Metal whale is a type of vehicle in SimCity 4: Rush Hour</a>. It is unlocked via <a href="Area_5.1..html" title="Area 5.1." class="mw-redirect">Area 5.1</a> and it can only be driven in the water.  As long as Area 5.1 is present in the city, it will be unlocked; it does not matter whether or not the compound is near water. It functions similarly to a submarine (unavailable in the game), being that it travels slightly underwater. The depth that you travel in cannot be raised nor lowered, which limits you to only normal vehicular movement.   Trivia Although the watercraft is technically underwater, you will still sink if you collide with other sea vessels. As the "whale" travels, you will hear metallic sounds coming from it. This is the only vehicle in the game which emits this sound.
