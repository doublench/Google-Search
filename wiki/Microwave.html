The Microwave disater will occur only if you have a Microwave Power Plant. When the beam from the orbiting satellite misses the M.P.P. and hits something else instead, the Microwave disaster is initiated. A large fire will start near the receiver dish. Be sure to clean up the fires before the microwave power plant catches on fire. If you don't want this to happen, you can disable disasters.
