Biography "In contrast to his folksy demeanor, Moe Biehl is a well-connected political insider. His credentials, never independently verified, include Alderman, Ombudsman, Councilman, Chairman, Elector (appointed), Sergeant at Arms, and Minority Whip “There isn’t a function of city government I don’t know something about,” he admits. Moe feels right at home as Transportation Advisor, despite accusations that he has never set foot on a bus, subway or train in his entire life."
