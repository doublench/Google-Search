Biography "Mortimer Green received his Ph.D. in Post-Classical Economics from Grendletown University and accepted a teaching position there. During his tenure, he worked to turn the Economics Department into a now widely respected model of idealised application. His book, “Tightening The Belt: A Primer for Parsimonious Pro Formas” is considered the definitive book on frugality theory. Green left the Ivory Tower to follow his dream of public service. He rarely regrets the decision."
