A nuclear power plant are power plant in SimCity that generate electricity using nuclear fission. This power plant is one of the few energy choices that emit no pollution, but must be carefully maintained, as nuclear accidents are dangerous and may affect a player's city and <a href="Mayor_Rating.html" title="Mayor Rating" class="mw-redirect">mayor rating</a> negatively for many years. Environmental groups tend to disapprove of nuclear power.  SimCity 4  In <a href="SimCity_4.html" title="SimCity 4">SimCity 4</a>, nuclear power plants can be constructed to provide a city with a power source. However, this power plant is not available at the beginning of the game, and must be earned through meeting the minimum requirements. Like other clean energy options, it is expensive to maintain, so it is not a recommended source of power for cities that are unable to financially support the power plant. If they are not looked after well enough (e.g. understaffed, underfunded) a <a href="Nuclear_Meltdown.html" title="Nuclear Meltdown" class="mw-redirect">meltdown</a> may occur, which will release <a href="Radiation.html" title="Radiation">radiation</a> into the surrounding area. This power plant will provide jobs for Sims, and although wealthier Sims are preferred, the plant will hire low-wealth workers if there are not sufficient mid to high wealth residents. The wealth level of the workers will not affect how the power plant is run. Nuclear Power Plant - §40,000   Monthly Cost: §3,000  Power Generated: 16,000 MWh/Month  Possibility of a meltdown  Requirements:   – Total city size: 85,000  – Total city energy demand plus deals: 25,000  SimCity (2013)  "Educated Sims and large amounts of water can create free, albeit radioactive, power. Careful! If this power plant is staffed with unskilled workers, it may emit variable amounts of radiation." — SimCity (2013)  In <a href="SimCity_(2013).html" title="SimCity (2013)">SimCity (2013)</a>, nuclear power plants are similar to the one in SimCity 4. They are dangerous if they are not employed with educated Sims. A Nuclear Power plant cannot be built without a Department of Education in the region, as that is needed to build a University, which is needed to build the School of Science.
