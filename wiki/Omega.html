Omega Is a commodity produced by OmegaCo</a> factories that is the essential ingredient for the Omega megacorporation to franchises in nearly every city.  The resources needed to produce Omega are crude oil and raw ore. This can be done by plopping OmegaCo extractors. While Omega is highly demanding for the consumers, it generates a lot of pollution and consume high amounts of water and power, and the factories emit a signature purple/pink smoke in relation to that.
