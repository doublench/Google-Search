 The police force is a city's first line of defense in the battle against <a href="Crime.html" title="Crime">crime</a>. <a href="Police_station.html" title="Police station">Police stations</a> lower crime within a certain radius, which can be enlarged or shrunk depending on the funding you allocate for the individual stations.  Police stations are equipped with a small number of jail cells, but city jails are the best place for most criminals go. Prisons are considered undesirable and will lower the land value of the immediate surrounding area.        SimCity In <a href="SimCity.html" title="SimCity">SimCity</a>, the player can buy a police station for $500. At 100% funding, each station costs $100 a month to run.
