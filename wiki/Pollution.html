Pollution is a byproduct of certain buildings in the SimCity series. Pollution lowers the aura of the surrounding area and affects what kind of buildings the Sims will build (or won't build) in polluted zones. There are 2 kinds of pollution: Air Pollution and Water Pollution.    Air Pollution Air pollution is caused by dirty and manufacturing industry, certain power plants (such as coal and oil), traffic, and airports. It makes it hard for the Sims to breathe and deters them from developing in polluted zones.       Air Pollution Levels There are 5 levels of air pollution.  None If there is no air pollution on a tile, that means that the air is at its purest and the Sims will be happy to build any kind of building in a pollution-free zoned area. This is Great for building high density buildings and raising land value.  Low If the air pollution on a tile is low, things are just a little dirty. The Sims won't complain much, but the best buildings won't be built in low pollution. Land value decreases a little, but still enough for some high density buildings     High Once air pollution reaches high, things are getting musty. The Sims will begin to complain and your Environmental Adviser will begin to alert you to the growing problem. Most dirty industries will increase the problem. It lowers Land Value a lot, meaning you can only build a few Medium density buildings.  Very High It's starting to get hard to breathe for the Sims and most will want to stay away, especially Residential and Commercial. Land Value continues to lower, usually reaching low or very low.  Hazardous Once the pollution level reaches hazardous, there could be problems. Introduced in SimCity 3000 Unlimited are Toxic Clouds that will form above Industrial zones and produce acid rain, destroying buildings, trees, and any city infrastructure.  Preventing Air Pollution One way to prevent air pollution from getting too high is to activate certain <a href="City_ordinance.html" title="City ordinance">city ordinances</a>. Another is to reduce traffic congestion. Trees also help remove air pollution and keeping your Sims educated will encourage high-tech industry to move in, replacing the old, dirty factories with new, clean buildings. Keeping filthy business deals out of your city helps as well.  Water Pollution Water pollution is caused by all types of industry except for High Tech, as well as power plants, and seaports. Water pollution can gunk up your pumps and lower their working capacity. Standing water that is polluted has an obvious black tinge to it. The effects of water pollution are obvious if you query a pump near a polluted area. The current work capacity of the pump with be lower than its maximum output, even if the pump is brand new. If water pollution gets to be too bad in too many places, the Sims will complain.  Preventing Water Pollution Like air pollution, water pollution has several <a href="City_ordinance.html" title="City ordinance">city ordinances</a> attributed to it as well. Another method of preventing water pollution is to build a <a href="Water_Treatment_Plant.html" title="Water Treatment Plant">Water Treatment Plant</a>. It has a maximum capacity of 60,000 gallons of polluted water to process and this number lowers as it reaches the end of its life, but it's a good way to clean your city's water grid.
