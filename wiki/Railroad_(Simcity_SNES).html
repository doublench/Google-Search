Railroads are transport tiles used in <a href="SimCity_(SNES).html" title="SimCity (SNES)">SimCity (SNES)</a>  In Simcity (SNES) Railroads in Simcity SNES function almost identically to railroads in the <a href="SimCity.html" title="SimCity">SimCity</a> editions on other platforms.  They transport sims between the games zones, without the player having to worry about traffic congestion present on Roads</a>. Railroads can be placed on land tiles and water tiles as a Subway; however when placing in water the railroad is unable to place corners, these can only occur on land tiles.  Sims cannot join a rail line that is underwater, they can only transit through it. A single railcar can be spotted on the city's rail network, however this has no game effect.  Special Buildings Ater placing a certain number of Railroad titles, the player has the option of building a central station in their city.  Gallery
