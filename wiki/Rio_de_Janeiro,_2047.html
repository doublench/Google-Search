Rio de Janerio, Brazil, 2047 Global Warming is causing sea levels to rise all over the globe, and the city of Rio is suffering the ill effects of an undeveloped waterfront and general poor city planning. Occasional Floods will happen all throughout the scenario. Rio may be the most horribly planned city of all the Scenarios, as it has a LOT of Zone Overlap, where pieces of Residential Zones are cut up and new zones placed over the edges. Crime is also insane. Beating the main disaster of the Scenario requires the Player to build Park Land on every "shore edge" square on the map (thus "developing" the score line). However, to win the scenario, the city may need to be partially demolished and rebuilt anyway, just to eliminate the crime and promote proper zone growth.
