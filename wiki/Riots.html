 A riot happens if a city's population becomes very unhappy with the <a href="Mayor.html" title="Mayor">mayor</a>'s choices, or if they are being deprived of essential services, such as a prolonged blackout, and although uncommon, lack of sanitation services. Riots can be subdued very quickly if police response is immediate, however, they will cause massive amounts of damage to buildings and infrastructure if left alone. During the rioting, <a href="Sims.html" title="Sims" class="mw-redirect">Sims</a> will wander around the town/city's streets, looting from stores, throwing rubbish around, and in later stages, jumping on and turning over cars, as well as occasionally throwing objects that look and behave like Molotov cocktails, which (without proper fire coverage) may ignite surrounding buildings, causing destructive <a href="Fire.html" title="Fire">fires</a>, if left unattended.  If the riot is not subdued quickly, the size of the riot may increase, sometimes up to almost 20 tiles away (about 3 to 4 city blocks) from the original starting point. Sims will sometimes leave the roads and riot on private property, although this may simply be an error when they initially spawned.  Tips Riots are very rare; with even a poorly governed city, it is highly unlikely that the player will ever experience a riot without the help of external modifications.  Preferably don`t try to drive a firetruck to extinguish fires yourself; aside from the fact that it`s not practical, there is a glitch where sometimes you will have some difficulty deploying firemen around large groups of rioters. Riots will not occur within the radius of a police station, and any new station will automatically disperse existing riots.
