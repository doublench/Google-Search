The game was released on March 5, 2013 for Windows</a> PCs. An OS X</a> version was also announced and was subsequently released on August 29, 2013. SimCity began development in the spring of 2009. It is the first Maxis-developed main series SimCity game since <a href="SimCity_4.html" title="SimCity 4">SimCity 4</a>, released a decade prior. The game brought back the zoning feature, as well as a new multiplayer mode where a group of cities work together or compete in an online region. Curved roads also make their first appearance into the franchise. SimCity received positive reviews prior to release; however, as a result of widespread technical problems such as difficulty connecting to the game's servers, many reviewers lowered the game's review score as a result. As a result of this, <a href="EA.html" title="EA" class="mw-redirect">EA</a> has offered early buyers a free game from Origin.        Gameplay A new feature is that non-renewable resources</a> are finite, so if a player uses up their resources too quickly, their economy may collapse. However, players can trade resources with other players online. In the demo shown at E3, a mayor from Stoneslow was able to pipe electricity into Taylor City. Every individual <a href="Sim.html" title="Sim">Sim</a> has their own job, personality, education, life expectancy, etc. The design of the buildings is also customizable, as well as detailed traffic simulation, with cars lit up at night. Roads can be placed in different ways, such as straight, square, arched, freeform (curvy), and circular. There is no re-shaping of land in this game, although in <a href="SimCity_(2013)/Update_7.html" title="SimCity (2013)/Update 7">Update 7</a> the player can raise and lower land, to a limited extent. The environmental consequences of running a city are also explored in this game, focusing on global warming and other environmental issues such as air, water and ground <a href="Pollution.html" title="Pollution">pollution</a>. Like other aspects of the game, <a href="Crime.html" title="Crime">crime</a> is also more detailed. When a Sim commits arson, the player will hear gasoline being poured and a match being lit, as well as panicked Sims running from the building, some of them on fire. One unit's behavior,, such as moving into a new home and blocking the street with a moving van, could ripple out and cause a traffic jam, that in turn delays the response time of a fire truck attempting to put out a fire, which can result in a swath of the city burning. Regional play areas that allow co-operative players to collaborate and create <a href="Great_work.html" title="Great work">great works</a>. These can benefit the region, such as <a href="International_airport.html" title="International airport">bringing in</a> more tourists</a> and allowing the purchase of solar power</a> at a reduced cost. The feature of zoning <a href="Residential.html" title="Residential">residential</a>, <a href="Commercial.html" title="Commercial">commercial</a>, and <a href="Industrial.html" title="Industrial">industrial</a> zones return, however players will no longer be able to zone in different densities. Densities are now based on road sizes and traffic around the location of the zoned area. Online multiplayer features regions that may house multiple cities from a variety of players. Mayors can also work together. In a demo presented at E3, several mayors were able to team up to create an airport. To access online features, players will have to be logged into an EA Origin account. Additionally, launching the game each time will require the player to be logged in to Origin. In Update 10</a>, a new offline mode was introduced, allowing the player to play in single-player, and also allowing the player to switch between single-player and multiplayer at will.   Disasters In SimCity (2013), <a href="Disasters.html" title="Disasters">disasters</a> can now again occur randomly, although in Update 8</a> players can now disable disasters by enabling the "Disable Random Disasters" option in the settings menu. Like in SimCity 4, the player can summon disasters by using the disasters tab. In multiplayer mode, disasters have to be unlocked by completing <a href="Achievements.html" title="Achievements">achievements</a>, while in singleplayer mode, disasters are unlocked automatically, as achievements cannot be earned in singleplayer mode. The disasters in SimCity (2013) are:  <a href="Meteor_strike.html" title="Meteor strike" class="mw-redirect">Meteor strike</a> <a href="Earthquake.html" title="Earthquake">Earthquake</a> <a href="UFO_encounter.html" title="UFO encounter" class="mw-redirect">UFO encounter</a> <a href="Big_lizard.html" title="Big lizard">Big lizard</a> <a href="Tornado.html" title="Tornado">Tornado</a> <a href="Zombie_attack.html" title="Zombie attack">Zombie attack</a> <a href="Outworlder_6.html" title="Outworlder 6">Outworlder 6</a> (requires <a href="Cities_of_Tomorrow.html" title="Cities of Tomorrow" class="mw-redirect">Cities of Tomorrow</a>)  Notable gameplay differences Italics denote former gameplay differences.

It provides two save slots (as opposed to ten in the regular game), two regions (<a href="Cape_Trinity.html" title="Cape Trinity">Cape Trinity</a> and <a href="Reflection_Atoll.html" title="Reflection Atoll">Reflection Atoll</a>), as well as being playable only in single-player mode. Save files in the trial version are transferable if the player chooses to purchase the full version of the game, as save files are stored locally.   Reception and legacy SimCity received mostly mixed to negative reviews on release, mostly due to the always online requirement, severe technical issues at launch, and the lengthy delay between server restorations.  Almost every review of the game had negatively reviewed the game's always online requirement, most citing that taking an offline single player series and forcing players to play online weather they want to or not was not a good idea. Currently, the game is the lowest rated SimCity title to date, even behind <a href="SimCity_Societies.html" title="SimCity Societies">SimCity Societies</a>, which was noted for its negative reception from fans. Due to the severe backlash and negative reviews due to the always online requirement of SimCity, On May 6th, 2013, EA and Maxis revealed The Sims 4</a>, released on September 2, 2014. Maxis stated in a video that the reason The Sims 4 will not require internet and will not have online features is to avoid another fan backlash, as EA and Maxis were not expecting such a huge backlash over the online requirement of SimCity. They also revealed in a video that The Sims 4 will use the same engine SimCity uses GlassBox, and hinted at the possibility of a feature SimCity 4 and The Sims 2 had, where the player could make a city layout in SimCity 4, and use it in The Sims 2. They hinted that may be implemented at a later date.   Videos  Gallery  See also <a href="Interface_(SimCity_(2013)).html" title="Interface (SimCity (2013))">Interface (SimCity (2013))</a>  References      <a href="SimCity_(series).html" title="SimCity (series)">SimCity series</a>    Main series  <a href="SimCity.html" title="SimCity">SimCity</a> (<a href="SimCity_Classic.html" title="SimCity Classic">Classic</a>) · <a href="SimCity_2000.html" title="SimCity 2000">SimCity 2000</a> · <a href="SimCity_3000.html" title="SimCity 3000">SimCity 3000</a> (<a href="SimCity_3000_Unlimited.html" title="SimCity 3000 Unlimited" class="mw-redirect">Unlimited</a>) · <a href="SimCity_4.html" title="SimCity 4">SimCity 4</a> (Rush Hour</a> · Deluxe Edition</a> · <a href="The_SimCity_Box.html" title="The SimCity Box">The SimCity Box</a>) · SimCity (2013) (<a href="SimCity_Cities_of_Tomorrow.html" title="SimCity Cities of Tomorrow">Cities of Tomorrow</a> · <a href="SimCity_Plus_Edition.html" title="SimCity Plus Edition">Plus Edition</a>)    Console games  <a href="SimCity_(SNES).html" title="SimCity (SNES)">SimCity (SNES)</a> · <a href="SimCity_2000_(console).html" title="SimCity 2000 (console)">SimCity 2000</a> · <a href="SimCity_64.html" title="SimCity 64">SimCity 64</a> · <a href="SimCity_DS.html" title="SimCity DS">SimCity DS</a> · <a href="SimCity_Creator_(Wii).html" title="SimCity Creator (Wii)">SimCity Creator</a> (<a href="SimCity_Creator_(DS).html" title="SimCity Creator (DS)">DS</a>)    Spin-offs  <a href="SimFarm.html" title="SimFarm">SimFarm</a> · <a href="SimCopter.html" title="SimCopter">SimCopter</a> · <a href="Streets_of_SimCity.html" title="Streets of SimCity">Streets of SimCity</a> · <a href="SimTown.html" title="SimTown">SimTown</a> · <a href="SimCity_Societies.html" title="SimCity Societies">SimCity Societies</a> (<a href="SimCity_Societies_Destinations.html" title="SimCity Societies Destinations" class="mw-redirect">Destinations</a> · Deluxe Edition</a> · <a href="The_SimCity_Box.html" title="The SimCity Box">The SimCity Box</a>) · The Sims Carnival: SnapCity</a> · <a href="SimCity_Social.html" title="SimCity Social">SimCity Social</a> · <a href="SimCity_BuildIt.html" title="SimCity BuildIt">SimCity BuildIt</a> (Not yet released)
