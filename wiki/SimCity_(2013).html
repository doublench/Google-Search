 SimCity may also refer to "<a href="SimCity_(2013_game).html" title="SimCity (2013 game)" class="mw-redirect">SimCity</a>", a 2013 reboot of the series.  SimCity is a simulation and city-building personal computer game, first released in 1989 and designed by <a href="Will_Wright.html" title="Will Wright">Will Wright</a>. SimCity was <a href="Maxis.html" title="Maxis">Maxis</a>' first product, which has since been ported into various personal computers and game consoles. Until the release of The Sims in 2000, the <a href="SimCity_series.html" title="SimCity series" class="mw-redirect">SimCity series</a> was the best-selling line of computer games made by Maxis.        History The idea for SimCity comes from various places. Will Wright came up with the idea when he spent more time making maps for Raid on Bungling Bay than playing the game. Wright also cites The Seventh Sally", a short story by Stanislaw Lem, as an inspiration for the game. The first version of the game was on the Commodore 64 and was finished in 1985. Wright spent four years trying to find a publisher. Many major publishers, including Brøderbund, were scared off by the innovative gameplay of SimCity. Finally, Maxis agreed to sell it as one of their two initial games. In 1988, SimCity was shown to Brøderbund again. The company decided to enter into a distribution agreement with Maxis. That year, the game was released for the Amiga and Macintosh. Versions for the IBM PC and Commodore 64 were released the following year.  Gameplay In SimCity, players build a city. The game doesn't have a specific goal, so the player can't win or lose. The player can zone areas as <a href="Residential.html" title="Residential">residential</a>, <a href="Commercial.html" title="Commercial">commercial</a>, or <a href="Industrial.html" title="Industrial">industrial</a>, add buildings, adjust the tax rate, construct power lines, and build roads, among other things. Depending on how the player builds his city, people will move to his city or leave. As the population grows, the player must accommodate their needs. In certain versions of SimCity, players get rewards for having a large population.  Disasters Players will sometimes have to face disasters such as giant fires and earthquakes. They can happen randomly or can be purposely triggered by the player. In scenarios, disasters occur at predetermined moments. Not all disasters were available in every version of SimCity. The disasters in SimCity are as follows:  <a href="Bomb_Drop.html" title="Bomb Drop">Bomb Drop</a> (Hamburg only, not selectable from menu) <a href="Earthquake.html" title="Earthquake">Earthquake</a> <a href="Fire.html" title="Fire">Fire</a> <a href="Flood.html" title="Flood">Flood</a> <a href="Monster.html" title="Monster">Monster</a> <a href="Nuclear_Meltdown.html" title="Nuclear Meltdown" class="mw-redirect">Nuclear Meltdown</a> (Not selectable from menu) <a href="Plane_Crash.html" title="Plane Crash">Plane Crash</a> <a href="Ship_Wreck.html" title="Ship Wreck">Ship Wreck</a> (Not selectable from menu) <a href="Tornado.html" title="Tornado">Tornado</a> <a href="UFO.html" title="UFO">UFO</a> (Las Vegas (SNES) only, not selectable from menu)  Scenarios Main article: <a href="List_of_Power_Plants_in_the_SimCity_Francise.html" title="List of Power Plants in the SimCity Francise" class="mw-redirect">List of Power Plants in the SimCity Francise</a>  Scenarios were included as different way to play SimCity. Rather than having no goals and as much time as the player wanted, scenarios gave the player a goal and a time limit. Scenarios in SimCity replicated a real city and sometimes a real event. As with the disasters, not all scenarios were available with every version of SimCity. The following are the scenarios included:  <a href="Bern,_1965.html" title="Bern, 1965">Bern, Switzerland,1965</a> Traffic <a href="Boston,_2010.html" title="Boston, 2010">Boston, MA, 2010</a> Nuclear Destruction! <a href="Detroit,_1972.html" title="Detroit, 1972">Detroit, MI, 1972</a> Crime <a href="Dullsville,_USA,_1900.html" title="Dullsville, USA, 1900">Dullsville, USA, 1900</a> Boredom <a href="Freeland,_1991.html" title="Freeland, 1991">Freeland, 1991</a> <a href="Hamburg,_Germany,_1944.html" title="Hamburg, Germany, 1944">Hamburg, Germany, 1944</a> Fire <a href="Las_Vegas,_2096.html" title="Las Vegas, 2096">Las Vegas, 2096</a> Alien Invasion! <a href="Rio_de_Janeiro,_2047.html" title="Rio de Janeiro, 2047">Rio de Janeiro, 2047</a> Global Warming! <a href="San_Francisco.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco, 1906</a> 8.0 Earthquake! <a href="Tokyo,_1961.html" title="Tokyo, 1961">Tokyo, Japan,1961</a> Godzilla!

The reason it was released was due to the OLPC requiring games to be open source, and EA wanted to donate.
