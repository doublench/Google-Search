SimCity (SNES) was the first console game in the SimCity Series, and one of the launch titles for the SNES. It was developed by Nintendo EAD (under license from <a href="Maxis.html" title="Maxis">Maxis</a>) and published by Nintendo in 1990.        Gameplay The gameplay is similar to the PC version except that there are more buildings and scenarios. The style of the buildings also resemble those in Japan rather than those of North America in the PC version. Another new feature is the new adviser named Dr. Wright, who is a parody of Will Wright, creator of the Simcity Series and its sequels. He usually reports the population growth of the city and disasters that happen. Also, there is Nintendo related easter eggs in the game. Such as Bowser attack (who replaces the Godzilla disaster in the computer versions) on the player's city and the unlockable Mario statue.
