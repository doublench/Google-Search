SimCity Creator is the name of SimCity's Wii installment. <a href="SimCity_Creator_(DS).html" title="SimCity Creator (DS)">SimCity DS 2</a> is also called SimCity Creator outside Japan. SimCity Creator was released in September 2008.        Overview  SimCity Creator follows the basic SimCity formula that sees players managing a city and placing residential, commercial and industrial zones, in addition to building facilities such as police stations, hospitals, seaports, and stadiums. However, players will also be able to customize the look of their buildings by choosing from several themed hero buildings that give themes to the city such as Egyptian, Roman, Japanese, European, Las Vegas, Asian and near-future styles, in addition to ones that result in a crystal or confectionery-like appearance to buildings. Players will also be able to tour their city, rendered in 3D graphics, in a helicopter or airplane. Taking advantage of the Wii, the pointer function of the Wii Remote will be used to directly to draw curvy and straight roads and train tracks onto the map. Cities can also be shared among players through WiiConnect24. The game's advisors have been redesigned to resemble MySims</a> characters. Similar to <a href="SimCity_4.html" title="SimCity 4">SimCity 4</a>, SimCity Creator features a day and night cycle, as well as a seasonal cycle last seen in the SNES version of SimCity.
