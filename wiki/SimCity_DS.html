SimCity DS is a city-building game for the Nintendo DS. The game is an enhanced remake of SimCity 3000, having mostly the same gameplay and graphics. It was released in 2007. Gameplay SimCity DS takes advantage of the special features of the Nintendo DS. The top screen displays the city while the bottom screen displays maps, charts, and other such things. Certain "action events" require the player to use the stylus. Rather than having multiple advisors, players have to choose one. The advisors include Mr. Maxis (who looks strangely like <a href="Will_Wright.html" title="Will Wright">Will Wright </a> and will later appear in SimCity Creator(DS) ), Julie McSim</a>, Ayako Tachibana, Kaishu Tachibana, Servo 3000, and a secret advisor called Alien. Players can also listen to regular citizens who will ask for an ordinance to be enacted, offer a deal, or ask for a certain building. SimCity DS also includes <a href="Landmarks.html" title="Landmarks">landmarks</a>. However, they must be unlocked by completing certain tasks in the game or through passwords. The game includes several unique landmarks, including Bowser's Castle</a>. As a special promotion with Wal-Mart, the password for the Jefferson Memorial was only included in games they sold. The password is THOMPSON. Disasters also return in this version of SimCity. However, disasters become minigames. Players must blow into the DS microphone to blow out fires or use the touch screen to fire missiles at a giant ape, for example. In addition to disasters scenarios returned but now called Save the City. The player must help save the city from disasters or economy issues. Another new aspect of the game is research. Players must allocate a certain amount of money toward research in order to unlock certain buildings. The game makes use with the Nintendo DS Local Wireless by sending letters about his/hers city or share passwords to unlock landmarks. Though the local wireless feature is limited a Wi-Fi mode was going to be in the game where the player can compare other cities but it was scraped.
