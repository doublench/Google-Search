Space junk is a disaster seen only in <a href="SimCity_3000_Unlimited.html" title="SimCity 3000 Unlimited" class="mw-redirect">SimCity 3000: Unlimited Edition</a>. When triggered, the space junk will rain down and hit a building and destroy it. When the space junk hits the ground, there is a possibility that the local terrain is modified to resemble a crater.
