One of the main attractions of the game is the ability to explore into cities created in SimCity 2000 by car.  Like <a href="SimCopter.html" title="SimCopter">SimCopter</a>, this game is playable in full 3D and the player's vehicle can be controlled using a keyboard, a joystick, or a gamepad. The game's network mode is also a notable feature in which deathmatches can be played with seven other individuals.        Gameplay The game offers different game modes:  Career The career mode is primarily mission-based, in which the player takes part in one of four television shows, with missions being presented as "episodes." There are four different shows to choose from, each with a set of episodes that increase in difficulty.  Zippy's Courier Service  Players take the role of a package deliveryman who must make a certain number of deliveries in a certain amount of time; as the game progresses, his package delivery operation expands.  Galahad's Watch  The player has to first weed out corrupt cops and then uncover and stop a vast criminal plot.  Granny's Wild Ride  Has players play the part of Granny, who has discovered plans for an alien invasion that must be stopped at all costs.  Race for Your Life  Involves the player in a number of races as a race car driver.  A fifth, untitled category also exists, containing several unrelated missions that include post-apocalyptic deliveries, deathmatches, and, in a lot of cases, following a plot line specific to that mission. The details and objectives vary from mission to mission in this category.  Players' Choice This is a non-mission mode, and allows the exploration of any of the more than fifty included cities or a city created in <a href="SimCity_2000.html" title="SimCity 2000">SimCity 2000</a> or SCURK</a>. Four levels of difficulty are available in this mode: Sunday Driver, Bad Hair Day, Commuter's Revenge, and Crush Hour.  Sunday Driver features neither traffic nor packages to deliver, allowing uninterrupted exploration of a city. Bad Hair Day, Commuter's Revenge, and Crush Hour feature increasingly well-armed and insistent enemy vehicles, and more packages. Packages can be recognized by their distinctive appearance and are represented on the minimap as green dots. Delivering a package to its destination in time results in a cash reward.  SCURK (SimCity Urban Renewal Kit) The SCURK is an editing program packaged with the game designed to allow the creation and editing (but not simulation) of cities for use with Streets of SimCity.  Network A non-mission play mode in which two or more players can establish a deathmatch with a selection of four different connection options. The player can join a room or create their own, give themself a name, a car, establish rules, and choose the map on which the match will take place. Up to seven players at a time may play on a single map. There are two online play specific options:  Deathmatch  A player is out of the game once the player's car is destroyed; the last remaining player is the winner.  Freeplay  Players are not withdrawn from the match when their cars are destroyed. This mode also uses a point system. Players can also team up (This feature requires an even number of players on the map). The Streets of SimCity online community is relatively small, so most players end up playing matches with people they already know.      <a href="SimCity_(series).html" title="SimCity (series)">SimCity series</a>    Main series  <a href="SimCity.html" title="SimCity">SimCity</a> (<a href="SimCity_Classic.html" title="SimCity Classic">Classic</a>) · <a href="SimCity_2000.html" title="SimCity 2000">SimCity 2000</a> · <a href="SimCity_3000.html" title="SimCity 3000">SimCity 3000</a> (<a href="SimCity_3000_Unlimited.html" title="SimCity 3000 Unlimited" class="mw-redirect">Unlimited</a>) · <a href="SimCity_4.html" title="SimCity 4">SimCity 4</a> (Rush Hour</a> · Deluxe Edition</a> · <a href="The_SimCity_Box.html" title="The SimCity Box">The SimCity Box</a>) · <a href="SimCity_(2013).html" title="SimCity (2013)">SimCity (2013)</a> (<a href="SimCity_Cities_of_Tomorrow.html" title="SimCity Cities of Tomorrow">Cities of Tomorrow</a> · <a href="SimCity_Plus_Edition.html" title="SimCity Plus Edition">Plus Edition</a>)    Console games  <a href="SimCity_(SNES).html" title="SimCity (SNES)">SimCity (SNES)</a> · <a href="SimCity_2000_(console).html" title="SimCity 2000 (console)">SimCity 2000</a> · <a href="SimCity_64.html" title="SimCity 64">SimCity 64</a> · <a href="SimCity_DS.html" title="SimCity DS">SimCity DS</a> · <a href="SimCity_Creator_(Wii).html" title="SimCity Creator (Wii)">SimCity Creator</a> (<a href="SimCity_Creator_(DS).html" title="SimCity Creator (DS)">DS</a>)    Spin-offs  <a href="SimFarm.html" title="SimFarm">SimFarm</a> · <a href="SimCopter.html" title="SimCopter">SimCopter</a> · Streets of SimCity · <a href="SimTown.html" title="SimTown">SimTown</a> · <a href="SimCity_Societies.html" title="SimCity Societies">SimCity Societies</a> (<a href="SimCity_Societies_Destinations.html" title="SimCity Societies Destinations" class="mw-redirect">Destinations</a> · Deluxe Edition</a> · <a href="The_SimCity_Box.html" title="The SimCity Box">The SimCity Box</a>) · The Sims Carnival: SnapCity</a> · <a href="SimCity_Social.html" title="SimCity Social">SimCity Social</a> · <a href="SimCity_BuildIt.html" title="SimCity BuildIt">SimCity BuildIt</a> (Not yet released)
