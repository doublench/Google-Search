Taxes is the main source of income for any city in the SimCity series. The amount of revenue made by taxes is affected by the population of the city and land values</a> as well as the set tax rate. Lowering taxes will increase growth of a city and improve <a href="Mayor_Rating.html" title="Mayor Rating" class="mw-redirect">approval ratings</a>, but will decrease the city's income. Raising taxes will increase cash going into the city treasury, but approval ratings will take a hit and growth will be slowed.        SimCity In <a href="SimCity.html" title="SimCity">SimCity</a>, there's a simple flat tax. Every <a href="Residential.html" title="Residential">residential</a>, <a href="Commercial.html" title="Commercial">commercial</a>, and <a href="Industrial.html" title="Industrial">industrial</a> zone pays the tax.  SimCity 2000 The tax system is a bit more complex in <a href="SimCity_2000.html" title="SimCity 2000">SimCity 2000</a>. The player can set a flat tax, but also has the option to set different taxes for different zones. Using the industry panel, the player can further adjust the tax rate for the different types of industries.  SimCity 3000 In <a href="SimCity_3000.html" title="SimCity 3000">SimCity 3000</a>, the player is still able to adjust tax rates for the various zones. However, the option to tax different industries is gone. They were replaced by several city ordinances</a>.  SimCity 4 <a href="SimCity_4.html" title="SimCity 4">SimCity 4</a>'s tax system gives the player even more control. Not only can players set different tax rates for different types of zones (residential, commercial, and industrial), they can also set the rate for different wealth levels (low, medium, and high wealth). Taxes can be manually adjusted, from a minimum taxation rate of 0.0% to a maximum of 20.0%, although the default tax rate is 9.0% for all categories.  SimCity (2013) In <a href="SimCity_(2013).html" title="SimCity (2013)">SimCity (2013)</a>, at the beginning of a region you must have a <a href="City_Hall.html" title="City Hall" class="mw-redirect">Town Hall</a> placed in the region placed to control taxes. Once you have a town hall you control all places that give taxes. Once you have 5,000 citizens and upgraded to a City Hall (or one in the region) you can control each type of zone's taxes. Once you add a Financial Building module to the City Hall you can control all wealth levels and zones. An interesting quirk - a majority of the game's mechanics appear to be tied to tax rate as a multiplier.  As a result, setting your tax rate to 0% results in your sims never becoming unhappy or sick. This allows you to create a city with the highest possible population by only zoning the entire city as residental and neglecting all services.  See  for a working example.  Trivia An interesting note is that Herman Cain's  suggested in his 2012 campaign is often compared to the taxation system used in SimCity 4, because it mirrored the game's default tax rates.
