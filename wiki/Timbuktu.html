Timbuktu is a pre-made <a href="Region.html" title="Region">region</a> available in <a href="SimCity_4.html" title="SimCity 4">SimCity 4</a>. It is a starting region, and 5 tutorial cities are pre-built in the map to guide new players into learning the tools available. Cities include:  Big City Tutorial</a> Making Money Tutorial</a> Terraforming Tutorial</a> Getting Started Tutorial</a> Rush Hour Tutorial</a>  Mayors can choose to continue building these cities in addition to starting a new city on a blank tile.  Trivia  The region is probably based on the real life location  in the West African nation Mali. Even with the 'Show City Name' option unchecked, the tutorial city names will still appear. Along with London and Berlin, it is one of the only regions with pre-built cities incorporated in the region. Although it serves as a tutorial region, gameplay does not differ from other regions, and tutorial cities can be skipped.
