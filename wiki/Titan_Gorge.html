</a> This massive region features sixteen diverse city sites grouped into four clusters. Titan Gorge runs down the heart of the valley, ending at a bulge in the Reposado River. A soaring rail trestle spans the wide gap between two expansive plateaus.  Titan Gorge is one of the <a href="Region.html" title="Region">regions</a> featured in <a href="SimCity_(2013).html" title="SimCity (2013)">SimCity (2013)</a>. It has 16 city sites and 4 <a href="Great_work.html" title="Great work">great work</a> sites.  City sites Conestoga Crossing </a>  This site is rich in water with a smattering of raw ore deposits. The Reposado River snakes through this site, supporting <a href="Global_Market.html" title="Global Market" class="mw-redirect">Global Market</a> trading.  Pioneer Plains </a>  A generous crude oil reservoir has long lured would-be oil barons to this grassy site. Expansive plains provide plenty of room to build a sprawling city.  Frontier Fields </a>  This site has deep deposits of crude oil waiting to be pumped dry. A railroad provides convenient shipping for industrial cities.  Settler's Rest </a>  The banks of the Reposado River wind through a corner of this site, providing a spot for distributing the crude oil or raw ore from the deposits under this site.    Wrangler's Rest </a>  Abundant coal and raw ore make this an ideal location for a metals business. Winds flowing across this plain provide plenty of fuel for wind power.  Painted Point </a>  A beautiful view of Titan Gorge and underground mineral deposits make this a popular place to live and work.  Palomino </a>  This windswept plateau was home to a horse ranch that would ship horses on the railroad that runs through the site. Small deposits of raw ore are scattered through this site.  Mustang Run </a>  The windy expanses of this site hide ample deposits of coal. The railroad running along this site provides a connection to the Global Market.    Placer Vista </a>  This site provides breathtaking views of the gorge, the former site of a placer mine. A sizable coal deposit serves as a foundation for a mining operation.  Claim Overlook </a>  Beautiful, steep views of Titan Gorge make for a scenic community. The petrified forest in this site surrounds plentiful coal and raw ore deposits.  Nugget Plateau </a>  Scant coal and raw ore deposits provide a challenge for new mayors, but the vast plains of this site allow for plenty of expansion. Strong breezes and warm weather make this an ideal retirement community.  Prospect </a>  This ore claim has mostly run dry, but there are still coal deposits waiting to be mined. Heavy winds provide a convenient source of power.    Pinewood Hills </a>  Gently rolling hills cover this wide plain. An underground river of oil provides a choice for location for a drilling operation. An inlet of the Reposado River connects this site to the river.  Cedargates </a>  An old shipping rail runs through this site and can be used to ship the crude oil extracted from the bursting oil reservoir in this site.  Mesquite </a>  The Reposado River curves around this site, occupying a significant chunk of the area. Oil deposits somehow resist the flow of the river.  Hickory Ridge </a>  The scenic views from this hillside gap entice the wealthy to develop on this site, but the roadwork necessary to build here present a challenge.   Trivia  All the cities have something to do with what is traditionally considered the "western" United States:  The first group of four cities relate to the settling of the frontier. The second group of four has to do with wrangling. The third group of four has to do with the gold rush. The final group has to do with trees found in the west, two of which are used for barbecuing. Reposado River, mentioned in the overview, shares a name with a category of tequila</a>, which fits into the western/southwestern theme of the region.
