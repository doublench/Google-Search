Civic vehicles such as ambulances, school buses, city buses, police cruisers, among many more can be driven once unlocked. The player can also choose to control passenger trains, freight trains and even steam engines, but unlike automobiles, conducting a train requires manually changing the direction at a rail intersection when the player does not wish to proceed with the default route.

Trivia Cars will be unable to drive into water, but conversely, boats will sink if they reach the coastline, or anywhere too close to it. Planes and helicopters are unable to land anywhere except for the actual landing strips and helipads. Aircraft do not take damage no matter how many times you collide with structures.
