 Whirlpools are a type of <a href="Disaster.html" title="Disaster" class="mw-redirect">disaster</a> that is exclusive to <a href="SimCity_3000_Unlimited.html" title="SimCity 3000 Unlimited" class="mw-redirect">SimCity 3000 Unlimited</a>.Â  It destroys bridges, marinas and seaports that come within range. Ships will also be swallowed if they come close to a whirlpool. However, Sims, trees, roads, buildings, vehicles and aircraft are not affected. Whirlpools also will not occur if the city has no significant bodies of water.  This article is a stub</a>. You can help SimCity Wiki by  expanding it</a>.
