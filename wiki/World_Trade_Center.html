 The World Trade Center (built 1966-1971, destroyed 2001) is a set of two buildings available in <a href="SimCity_2000.html" title="SimCity 2000">Simcity 2000</a> and <a href="SimCity_3000.html" title="SimCity 3000">SimCity 3000</a>. Their real-life counterparts were named 1 WTC (North Tower) and 2 WTC (South Tower), and were part of the  World Trade Center complex, surrounded by buildings 3 through 7 (which also collapsed from structural failure during the 9/11 attacks).     History The World Trade Center was located in Lower Manhattan in New York City, New York from their initial construction until their destruction on September 11, 2001</a> by terrorists, when 2 planes crashed into each tower and causing severe fires on 8 floors in the South Tower and 6 floors in the North Tower, eventually in 56 and 102minutes later causing both to have a catastrophic structural failure, making both completely collapse to their foundations. When the South Tower collapsed it crushed World Trade Center building 4, split the Marriott hotel in half and severely damaged the Deutsche Bank Building  which caused it to eventually be deemed unsafe and was subsequently demolished.  When the North Tower collapsed it destroyed 5 and 6 World Trade Center, the rest of the Marriott Hotel and started severe fires in  7WTC</a> which caused it to collapse 6 hours later.  2753 people lost heir lives. The largest source of the deaths was the North Tower due to more than 1300 people trapped on the floors above the impact of a hijacked airliner</a>, as all stairwells were blocked. In reality, the New World Trade Center, which contains 6 high rise towers, a large memorial (with the 2 footprints of the twin towers), a museum and a large transport hub. Building 7 was completed in 2006, while 1 WTC will be completed in fall 2013. The entire site is expected to be completed in late 2015 and when done, One World Trade Center</a> (The successor to the Twin Towers ), will be the tallest tower in the United States. Although having less floors then the former Twin Towers, One World Trade Center will have 106 floors, but stand the same height level as the twin towers stood. This is achived via the 2 story observation deck.  Simcity 2000 and 3000 Officially, the towers appeared in these 2 titles. The entire complex appeared in SC 2000, while only the twin towers appeared in 3000. The twin towers in 3000 however were designed incorrect, as in game they are slightly smaller then their real life versions, and tower 1 is missing its antenna.   Simcity Creator, Simcity DS and Simcity Deluxe. All 3 versions above are a console/mobile port of Simcity 3000. Both towers were removed from the games, while other landmarks features were retained. In the game files for all 3, the towers textures and plop data remains.      See also <a href="Petronas_Twin_Towers.html" title="Petronas Twin Towers">Petronas Twin Towers</a> <a href="Empire_State_Building.html" title="Empire State Building">Empire State Building</a>
