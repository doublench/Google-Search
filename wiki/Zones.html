Zones offer some control over <a href="Developer_types.html" title="Developer types">developer types</a>. There are 3 zones, 1 for each category of developer type. Each zone is divided into densities, which allows the player to control the number of occupants or jobs each building supports. Higher densities mean higher occupants or jobs per building built. However, zoning at higher densities is more expensive, and before any medium or high density buildings start developing, the player must have a population of at least 1,100 and 26,000 people, respectively. Note, however, that the density of the zone has nothing to do with the <a href="Wealth.html" title="Wealth">wealth</a> of the development, except for low-density industrial, in which only farms develop.
